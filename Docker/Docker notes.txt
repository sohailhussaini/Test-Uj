Q) How is docker useful in this world?

A) We hav a project which use jenkins, oracle db, java, linux, maven, mongodb etc.
   if we install all these in one single server and we create Users and give these details
   to the specific prgmers and there is a chance that person might disturb other
   software as well as all are in one server, ex: jenkins devlper can disturb or crash 
   oracle db as he might try learning on main server.
   or this may also over burden the server perf too.
  
   To avoid this
   we will saperate all software. Ex: jenmkins one server, mongodb one server oracle one server etc..
   but this will over budget and we need to install os for all which will take more space and time

   To avoid all such cases
   We use Docker. In this we can create images which use only req libs/bins which are in MBs
   and create containers. Time taken for setup is also less
  
   VM ware run on Image/os installed kernel, ex: ubuntu kernel
   Docker runs on kernel which is used in machine, eg: windows for mine

> docker run hello-world     ---> to test if docker installed correctly

> docker version 

> docker images        -----> show all images

> docker images rm image_name   -----> removes image

> docker search ubuntu   ---> search all avaialbe ubuntu in docker hub

> docker pull centos     ----> pull  the latest image of centos

> docker run -it centos    ---> logs into centos server

> docker run -it -d centos      ---> -d , pulls the image if not avilable in your machine.
and will directly run the container without entering into it

> yum update -y              ---> update yum in centos

> yum install git       ---> install git in centos

> exit                ---> to come out of container

> docker ps -a    ---> show container id
