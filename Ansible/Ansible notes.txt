In ansible server machine

> yum install epel-release

> yum update

> yum install git python pythin-devel python-pip openssl ansible

> ansible --version

> cd/etc/ansible

> vi ansible.cfg   ---->confg file

in the above file 

enable or remove # symbol at 
inventory
sudo_user

in the same file host   ---> we need to define ip addr, 

> vi host

[local]            ----->grp name
localhost

[batch-23]         ----->grp name-2
197.167.7.1        ------> give all  ip servers of client machine
197.167.23.2
