Instalation:

1) Install JDK latest version. 
	Copy the folder path from C:/program files/java
	Set path, right click on my computer-->properties-->new-->add name: JAVA_HOME & path:C:/program files/java
		in below vairable click on path and add --> ;C:/program files/java/bin
2) Download apache maven and copy the path
	Set path, right click on my computer-->properties-->new-->add name: M2_HOME & path:C:/program files/M2
		in below vairable click on path and add --> ;C:/program files/M2/bin

3) To setup required plugin 
- mvn archetype:generate  (command in CMD)   (just like git init)
	type default project number shown:1586
	type default version number shown : 8
	Group id --> Type devops(or any name)     - this will be the build name
	artifact id --> Tpype Project-1
	Snapshot (ie., version name) --> keep deafult
	Package devops --> keep default
	Type Y








In Maven there are 3 repositories
1 - Local repository  (C:\Users\DELL\.m2)
2 - Central repository  -->https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/
3 - Remote repository  


To download the cmd mvn archetype:generate data in a file, use
- mvn archetype:generate > test-file


This is used to select which type of project which will be suitable to our project. Ideally Developers will select all these.
If not then devops engg has to create project with the suitable project plugins and folder structure. Copy this folders and
move the folders to github and have the link handy for jenkins automation of building process.
Developers also will use the same github link and add there code files in the same repository. Once all are done, then 
for the relase time, all these files will go for build process thru maven.
